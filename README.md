# My Portfolio Site

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio project! This site represents my first project received during the bootcamp I am currently attending. It showcases my initial skills in HTML and CSS, providing a foundation for future development work. 

Feel free to explore the code and see how I've implemented basic web design principles. This project is a significant milestone in my learning journey and demonstrates the progress I've made so far in the bootcamp.

Please note that this portfolio is a starting point and may be updated or replaced in the future as I continue to refine my skills and complete additional projects.
